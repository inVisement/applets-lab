## Expected Return by Sector
The returns are based on inVisement Fair Price Valuation algorithm. **Zero Expected Return** means it is fairly priced, 
Negative return means it is over priced, Positive return means it is underpriced.

- Intrinsic Return: shows the static value (and return) of the company based on their income statement without looking into their balance sheet and growth potentials.
- Growth Potential: shows the dynamic value (and return) of the comapny based on projection where they are going.
- Financial Position: shows the streingth of the comapny's balance sheet, assets, and liabilities.
- Time Return: is driven from the risk premium and time value of your money for investing in the comapny.
